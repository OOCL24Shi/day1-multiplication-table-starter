**Objective:** Today, we focused on the concept of tasking before coding, which involved listing tasks and creating a context map for them. We applied this practice to examples like the "Cute Number" and "Multiplication Table." Additionally, we learned best practices for git commits and explored two helpful tools: standup meetings and the ORID principle.

**Reflective**: productive

**Interpretive**: I encountered many new concepts, and, given my background as a business analyst, I’m not as experienced in coding as many of my peers. However, I found today’s sessions engaging and packed with valuable information. I’m excited for the upcoming lectures.

**Decision**: I plan to study harder and practice more, especially in coding, to strengthen my skills and keep up with the lessons.
